Welcome to MARX's documentation!
================================
**2012-01-27** |marx| 5.0 was released.  See :ref:`installing`
for links to the |marx| source code.  See :ref:`highlights` for important
information about this release.

|marx| is a suite of programs created and maintained by the
`MIT/CXC/HETG group <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/>`_ group and is designed
to enable the user to simulate the on-orbit performance of the Chandra
X-ray Observatory. |marx| provides a detailed ray-trace
simulation of how Chandra responds to a variety of astrophysical
sources and can generate standard FITS event files and images as
output. It contains detailed models for Chandra's High Resolution
Mirror Assembly (HRMA), the HETG and LETG gratings, and all the focal
plane detectors.

If you publish any work that made use of |marx|, please cite the
paper `Raytracing
with MARX: x-ray observatory design, calibration, and support (Davis et al. 2012, SPIE 8443, 84431A) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SPIE.8443E..1AD>`_.
