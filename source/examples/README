Each example has its own directory. Each directory is self contained with the following elements:
- .rst file with text that describes this example in RST format for sphinx
- a Makefile that runs all steps of the example.
- .inc files that contain input for the programs (marx, marxflux, ISIS, etc.) run in this example.
  The same files are also included in the .rst file to make sure they are always in sync.

If the example has been run, a lot of other files can be sitting around in the directory eg. fits, ps, png.
These can all be removed with ``make distclean``.

Run the example with ``make`` to generate the figures for the documentation. 

Pre-requisites for running examples
-----------------------------------
Currently, that's a little inconsistent. Some PATH are hardcoded, e.g. in /config/config.inc
but other lines in the makefile expect that the marx executables and the marx scripts as well as 
isis are in your path.

I have not yet decided which is the best way to approach this and will unify this later after
running the examples a little longer to see which solution is more robust.

Other TO-DO items
-----------------
The figures are generated with the current MARX version with ``make``. Hoewever, textual
output from MARX or ISIS is hardcoded in the rst files. This can lead to incosistent results.
-> Capture STOUT and include the output in the rst files with ..include .
