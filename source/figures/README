This directory contains scripts to make figures. 
Several figures are used in different parts of the manual, thus it is easier to 
collect the scripts that make them in a single directory at the root of the documentation source tree than
to dublicate them in different places. 
Other figures (e.g. plots generated when running the examples) live in the directory
where they are referenced. I decide on a figure-by-figure basis where I put them,
and this may not be entirely consistent.

Not all figures are automaticallt generated and thus not all figures are found here in 
"source/figures". Some figures are included directly in the version control system in "figures".
